# Samurai Rabbit Wooden Sandal

The SRWS is a Mounting Adapter for ERCFv2 that allows for mounting the system to walls or desks using wood screws.

It has two versions, Katana and Tanto.  Katana has additional mounting the universal box if you don't use the ERCT, while Tanto is for mounting the full system with the ERCT.

If you're using Katana, also screw the Universal Box into the the top of the Katana by inserting screws from the underside of the Katana through to the heat inserts on the bottom of the Universal Box.
